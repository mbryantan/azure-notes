# Microsoft Azure Virtual Training Day: Fundamentals

## Part One

### Key concepts and terms
- High Availability - Service is available AS MUCH as possible Shared responsibility
- Scalability - Scale up (adding CPU horsepower), Scale out (adding CPU cores) 
- Elasticity - Dynamic scalability
- Agility 
- Fault tolerance - Ability to avoid downtime. Microsoft reponsibility
- Disaster Recovery
- Global Reach
- Cost Predictability
- Security

### Cloud models
- Public Cloud 
- Private Cloud 
- Hybrid Cloud 

### Types of Cloud Services
- IaaS (Infrastructure) - Most flexible service. You configure and manage the hardware for your application. You manage Data & Access, Application, Runtime, OS, and VMs  
- PaaS (Platform) - Focus on application development. Platform management is handlded by cloud provider. You manage Data & access, and Applications
- SaaS (Service) - Pay-as-you go pricing. Users pay for subscription. You only manage Data & access

### Azure Core Services

- **Geographies** typically contains two or more Regions
- Each Azure region is paired with another region within the same geography.
- Before we create anything, we have to create a **Resource Group** first, which is a collection of Azure Resources.
- If you delete a Resource Group, all reources inside of it will be deleted.
- Availability Zones is more preferrable than Availability Sets
- SMB Protocol - Files

#### Storage Replication
- Locally-redundant storage (LRS)
- Zone redundant storage (ZRS)
- Geo-redundant storage (GRS)
- Read-access GRS (RA-GRS)
- Geo-zone redundant storage (GZRS)

### Database services 
- Cosmos DB - Globally distributed database service (AWS Aurora, GCP Cloud Spanner)
- Azure SQL - PaaS

### Big data and Analytics
- Azure Synapse Analytics (Formerly Azure SQL Data warehouse) - MPP Data warehouse
- Azure HDInsight - open-source analytics
- Azure Data Lake Analytics - on demand analytics job service

### AI
- Azure Machine Learning service - develop, train, track, and test ML models
- Azure ML Studio - drag-and-drop visual workspace

### Serverless
- Azure Functions - creates infrastructure based on an event
- Azure Logic Apps - creates workflows
- Azure Event Grid - routing 

### DevOps
- Devops Services
- DevTest Labs - quickly create environments

### Apps Services
- Quickly and easily build web and mobile apps for any platform and device

### Azure management tools
- Azure portal - Web portal
- Powershell - Windows based CLI
- Azure CLI - CLI for windows, linux, and MacOS
- Cloud Shell - Browser-based environment for Powershell or CLI
